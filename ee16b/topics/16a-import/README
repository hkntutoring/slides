These files were added for fa'20, when ee16b had a "quest"
in the third week with a large amount of 16a review material.
As such, they are "pinned" to those versions of the 16a
content, rather than a symlink. This means that compiling
`quest.tex` will never change between non-ee16b-related patches,
but fixes will need to manually backported. I'm also doubtful
that the quest structure will be used again in ee16b, so it
might be valuable in the future to move this content to an
archival branch.
